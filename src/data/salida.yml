  Salida (NE female Chultan **yuan-ti pureblood** with Survival +5) poses as a human guide in Port Nyanzaru, but she really works for Ras Nsi. She keeps him apprised of the activity of anyone who’s heading south in search of Omu. They communicate via _**sending stones**_. Salida keeps her _**sending stone**_ in a pouch and tries to join the player characters’ expedition as a guide, a warrior, or even as a lowly bearer or paddler.

  Salida is 5 feet 4 inches tall and 120 pounds. She is fit and completely looks the part of a seasoned explorer. Her garb covers up the scaly patches of skin that betray her true nature. Salida is skilled at crafting colorful insults and concocting believable lies to cover her true background. Her wit makes her an enjoyable traveling companion — a trait that she leverages to the fullest to join the characters’ expedition.
