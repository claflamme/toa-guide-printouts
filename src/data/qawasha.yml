  Qawasha (NG male Chultan **druid**) is a member of the Emerald Enclave based in Fort Beluarian. The druid travels with a **vegepygmy** companion named Kupalué, a Chultan word that means “walking weed.” Qawasha often refers to his companion simply as Weed. They communicate with each other using their own unique sign language. See appendix D for vegepygmy statistics.

  Qawasha would like to rid the jungle of its undead menace, so he deliberately leads adventurers through undead-infested regions. As he travels through the jungle, Qawasha calls out the names of unusual flora and fauna around him. The druid also has a knack for camping in places where chwingas (see appendix D) dwell, and he has experience dealing with the elemental spirits.

  If the characters hire Qawasha, he recommends that they also purchase a charter of exploration before leaving Fort Beluarian. Qawasha has witnessed firsthand the Flaming Fist’s mistreatment of adventurers who explore Chult without the requisite paperwork.

  Qawasha stands 6 feet 2 inches tall and weighs 180 pounds. Weed stands 3 feet tall and weighs about 30 pounds dry (50 pounds wet).
